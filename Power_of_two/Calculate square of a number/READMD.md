# Problem Statement

Given an integer `N`, return the square of the given integer **without using multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), or power function (`pow()`)**.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T`, the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `T` lines contains an integer `N`.

## Output Format

- For each test case, print the square of the given integer on a new line.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 50
- -10000 ≤ N ≤ 10000

## Time Limit

- 1 second

## Sample Input 1

```
2
3
-4
```

## Sample Output 1

```
9
16
```

### Explanation

- In the first test case, the square of 3 is 9.
- In the second test case, the square of -4 is 16.

## Sample Input 2

```
2
-13
1
```

## Sample Output 2

```
169
1
```

## Notes

- You must not use multiplication, division, or power functions to compute the square.
- Consider using addition, subtraction, loops, or bitwise
